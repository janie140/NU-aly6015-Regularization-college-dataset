# NU-aly6015-Regularization-college-dataset

Introduction

We are looking at a college dataset from ISLR library that contains a large number of US Colleges from the 1995 issue of US News and World Report. The dataset has 18 variables with 777 observations. 

We focus on building regularization models using Ridge and Lasso techniques. The goal is to predict the 'Grad.Rate' variable using these models. Regularization methods such as Ridge and Lasso help us mitigate overfitting and improve the generalization performance of our models.
